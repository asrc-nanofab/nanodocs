# SOP Formatting

## Tool SOPs

Every every SOP should begin with a title and table of contents. The first thing in the table should be the safety information. The second thing in the table should be the tool operation information. The third thing in the table, these are high-level SOPs, should be troubleshooting and important information.

```md
# Document Name 

## Overview and Safety 

1. Process and Tool Description
2. General Hazards
3. Personal Protective Equipment

## Process Steps

1. Numbered format for whatever the tool steps are.
2. Should have pictures and text from load to unload
3. Itemize as you see fit

## Troubshooting and Emergency

1. Common Issues and their solutions
2. Situations when they need to contact staff

```

This can be achieved by using the headings in the making of your SOP, and then rendering a TOC (Table of contents) on the first page.
