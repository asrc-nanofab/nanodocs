## Principle of Operation

To remove aluminum from a substrate - patterned or unpatterned.
---

## Material Requirements

### Equipment:

Substrate, glass Petri dish or beaker (for etchant), glass beaker (for rinse) and stainless steel tweezers

### Chemicals:

Aluminum Etchant (contains Phosphoric Acid, Nitric Acid, Acetic Acid and water)

- Aluminum Etchant Hazards:
    - Chemical  is  corrosive  to  the  eyes,  skin  and  mucous  membranes.  Causes irritation and burns. Vapors severely irritate the respiratory tract.
    - Do not mix with strong oxidants or organic materials.
    - Do not heat above 50°C.

### Personal Protective Equipment:

Trionic gloves on top of nitrile gloves, apron, safety glasses and face-shield

## Procedure

### Aluminum Etch

1. Rinse both beakers with DI water prior to beginning the process.
2. Stand the beaker to be used for rinsing on a few fab wipes in the hood and fill it with DI water so that the water level will cover the entire substrate.
3. Get a glass beaker that will fit your samples for processing - you should find one labeled 'Aluminum Etchant' on the shelves. Place it on fab wipes in the hood.
4. Carefully  pour  some  of  the  Aluminum  Etchant  into  the  glass  beaker  so  that  there is enough liquid to cover your submerged sample.
5. If  you  plan  to  heat  the  etch,  set  up  the  hotplate  in  the  hood  at  60°C. Expect  the temperature of the bath to be at least 10°C lower than the temperature of the hotplate.
6. Place the beaker of Aluminum Etchant on the hotplate and bring it up to temperature.
7. Calculate  the  etch  time  for  your  sample.  You  will  need  to  know  the  thickness  of  your aluminum layer.
    a. At 25°C, the aluminum will etch at a rate of approximately 180 nm/min.
    b. At 50°C, the aluminum will etch at a rate of approximately 660 nm/min.

8. Put your sample into the etchant and soak for the appropriate amount of time calculated in the previous step. Agitation of the Petri dish will accelerate the etch.

## DI Water Rinse

1. When the etch is complete, transfer the sample carefully to the DI water rinse beaker.
2. If you used tweezers to move the sample, make sure you leave them in the rinse beaker as well.
3. Let the sample and tools soak in DI water for 5 minutes.
4. Remove the sample from the rinse container.
5. Rinse the sample with DI water in the hood sink.

### Sample Dry

1. After the water rinse is finished, blow the sample dry with the N  gun. 2
2. After  getting  most  of  the  water  off,  you  can  dry  the  samples  more  in  an  oven  or on a hotplate if allowable for your sample.
3. Inspect sample for traces of un-etched aluminum. If features are small, use an optical microscope.  If  more  etch  time  is  required,  place  wafer  back  into  Petri  dish  with  the etchant for another 30 seconds while agitating. Repeat rinse and drying procedure.

### Cleanup

1. The etchant may be used for multiple etches. For temporary storage (&lt;1 day), place the top of the Petri dish over the etchant and store on fab wipes in the back of the hood. Make sure the dish is clearly labeled 'Aluminum Etchant'.
2. Dump the etchant waste into the carboy designated for acids.
3. Rinse the Petri dish once with DI water, and dump it into the same carboy.
4. Dump the DI rinse beakers into the acid carboy.
5. Rinse all the containers again with DI water in the hood sink. This time, dump them into the sink within the process hood.
6. Return all labware to its proper location. The Petri dish and the beaker can drip dry on fab wipes in the hood; however, remember to move them back to their storage location once dry.
7. Wipe up any drips in the area with chemical wipes and dispose in the trash.
8. Store the Aluminum Etchant in the nitric acid cabinet.
9. Inspect  all  of  the  PPE  to  ensure  it  did  not  come  in  contact  with  the  etchant  before returning it to its storage location.

## Accident Procedure

### Contact
- Skin: Remove contaminated clothing, wash skin with soap and water. If there is any irritation, get immediate medical attention.
- Eye: Immediately flush with water for at least 15 minutes while lifting upper and lower eyelids occasionally. Get immediate medical attention.
- Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting. Get immediate medical attention.
- Inhalation: Remove to fresh air. Resuscitate if necessary. Take care not to inhale any fumes released from the victim's lungs. Get immediate medical attention.

### Spills

If  a  small,  contained  spill  occurs, such as inside the hood, wipe it up with chemical wipes and dispose  of  them  in  the  proper  trash  container.  If  a  large  spill  occurs,  evacuate  the  area  and notify the cleanroom staff.
